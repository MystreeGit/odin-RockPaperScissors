# odin-RockPaperScissors
A UI RockPaperScissors game built using javascript. 

I created this project while following along The-Odin-Project fundementals course.
At first it was a simple Rock paper scissors game against an AI in the command console but later down in the lesson we revisted it and made a UI for it.
